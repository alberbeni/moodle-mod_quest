      <li><strong>Team Score</strong>: this parameter is only shown when the option <a href="help.php?module=quest&file=allowteams.html">Allow Teams</a> is selected in the QUESTOURnament. It is the percentage, set by the option <a href="help.php?module=quest&file=teamporcent.html">Percentage of Team Scoring</a>, of the total score obtained by the team to which the student belongs, that will be added to his individual score.</li>
      <li><strong>Score</strong>: It is the total individual score of the student, incorporating his challenges and answers scores and a percentage of his team score if it were necessary.</li>
  </ul>
    <p>It must be emphasized that the teachers have access to all the information listed above, while the students can only see that information if the teacher that defined the QUESTOURnament selected the option <a href="help.php?module=quest&file=showauthoringdetails.html">Show Authoring Details to the Students in Classifications</a>. In any other case, students will not have access to these partial data related to the challenges proposed by other students.</p>
  <p>By default, the ranking is ordered according to the total individual score obtained by each student, although this order can be modified by choosing another ordering parameter and pressing its name.</p>
  <p>It is also possible to access the ranking by teams through the option <a href="help.php?module=quest&file=teams.html">View Summary by Teams</a>.</p>
