<P align="justify">If this option is selected, the teacher will have
	to approve all the assessments made by the students that propose
	challenges in order to validate the scores given by them to the answers
	submitted by other students to those challenges.</P>
<P align="justify">The students' scores and ranking will not be
	modified till the teacher have approved the scores given by the
	students. The teacher will be able to modify those scores, being the
	scores given by the teachers the valid ones in case those are different
	from the ones given by the students that proposed the challenges.</P>
<P align="justify">If this option is not selected, the teacher will
	not be obliged to approve all the scores given by the students,
	although he will still be able to do it in the cases he considers it
	necessary. If the teacher modifies a score given by a student, the new
	score will be the one that will be part of the final individual score
	of the student. On the other side, if the teacher does not assess the
	answer again, the score used will be the one given by the student that
	proposed the challenge.</P>
