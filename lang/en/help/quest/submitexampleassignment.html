</P>

<P align="justify">This page allows to add a challenge in the
	QUESTOURnament using the following fields to specify its
	characteristics:</P>
<div align="justify">
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Title</strong>: name of the challenge, it should not
			include the name of the author of the challenge in order to keep the
			anonymity of its authorship, otherwise, the challenge could be
			refused of modified by the teacher.</li>
		<li><strong>Description</strong>: it is the body of the
			challenge, where the problem and the items to be included in the
			answer are presented. It must be clear and complete.</li>
		<li><strong>Maximum Score</strong>: it is the maximum score that
			the challenge will be able to reach, it is limited by the <a
			href="help.php?module=quest&file=maxcalification.html">Highest
				Score</a> of the QUESTOURnament to which the challenge belongs.</li>
		<li><strong>Initial Score</strong>: it is the score of the
			challenge when it is opened and that will vary during the development
			of the contest.</li>
		<li><strong>Starting Date</strong>: it sets the date in which the
			challenge is opened, this parameter can only be set by the teacher.
			When the challenge is added by a student, the starting date is the
			time when the challenge is added.</li>
		<li><strong>Closing Date</strong>: it sets the date in which the
			challenge is closed, after this date it will not be able to submit
			answers, although the author of the challenge or the teacher will
			still be able to assess the answers submitted during the lifetime of
			the challenge. It can not be subsequent to the <a
			href="help.php?module=quest&file=dateend.html">Closing Date</a> set
			for the QUESTOURnament.</li>
		<li><strong>Attachments</strong>: this will allow to specify the
			attachments if this possibility was set when the QUESTOURnament was
			defined.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The system will check that the title and/or description fields
		are not left empty, in which case an error message will be displayed
		and the challenge will not be added. The system will also check if the
		dates are coherent, and in the case that the closing date of the
		challenge is subsequent to the closing date of the QUESTOURnament to
		which it belongs, this date will be taken as the closing date for the
		challenge.</p>
	<p>For any challenge, if the initial score chosen is higher than
		the maximum score set, the maximum score will be also taken as initial
		score.</p>
