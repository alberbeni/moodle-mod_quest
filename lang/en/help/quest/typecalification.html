	<strong>Type of Grading</strong>
</P>

<P align="justify">
	This parameter sets the way in which the score of a challenge will
	vary. Each challenge proposed will have an initial score set by the
	parameter <a href="help.php?module=quest&file=initialpoints.html">Initial
		Score</a>, a maximum score set by the parameter <a
		href="help.php?module=quest&file=maxcalification.html">Highest
		Score</a> and an <a href="help.php?module=quest&file=tinitial.html">Initial
		Time</a> that sets the period, in days, from the date when the challenge
	opens during which the score of the challenge will not vary unless a
	correct answer is submitted and assessed. When the initial time is
	over, or once a correct answer is submitted and assessed, the score of
	a challenge will start to vary from the initial score in two possible
	different ways according to the value of this parameter:
</P>
<P align="justify">
	LINEAR: the score varies linearly, increasing till the closing date of
	the challenge, reaching by that time the maximum score set, or else
	till a correct answer is submitted and assessed, starting then to
	decrease till it reaches the zero value at the closing date of the
	challenge, unless the <a
		href="help.php?module=quest&file=nmaxanswers.html">Maximum Number
		of Right Answers</a> admitted have been received and assessed before
	closing date.
</P>
<P align="justify">EXPONENTIAL: the score varies following the same
	rules that in the linear case, but with an exponential,instead of
	linear, variation, reason for which the degree of variation increases
	with time.</P>
