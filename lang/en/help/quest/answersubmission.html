	<strong>Answer Challenge</strong>
</P>

<P align="justify">This page allows to answer the challenge.</P>
<P align="justify">The fields that will be presented are the
	following:</P>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Title</strong>: name that identifies the answer to be
		submitted.</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong>: this is the body of the answer
		to be submitted that must cover all the items specified by the
		challenge.</li>
	<li><strong>Attachments</strong>: if the sending of attachments is
		allowed, it will be possible to add them at the end of the body of the
		answer to be submitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The screen will be shown to the student divided in two areas, the
	upper one will contain a textarea to introduce the answer, and it will
	ask the answer's author his opinion about the level of difficulty of
	the challenge proposed by choosing among one of a set of the options
	presented, while in the lower one the challenge to be answered will be
	shown.</p>

<p align="justify">Beside the text Answer there is an icon with the
	image of a square root. When this icon is clicked, a screen in which
	any expression can be tested with the TEX filter provided by Moodle, is
	shown. The TEX filter turns expresions introduced with a correct
	sintaxis into mathematic equations with the same appearance that if
	they were shown by the Microsoft Word equation editor.</p>
<p align="justify">
	The PreviewAnswer button allows to access a screen that shows the
	aspect of the answer to be submitted after the Moodle text filters have
	been applied. This screen is the <a
		href="help.php?module=quest&file=windowpreview.html">PreviewAnswer
		Window</a>. The SaveAnswer button allows to save and submit the answer
	that had been introduced.
