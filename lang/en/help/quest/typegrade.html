	<strong>Getting Scores from Students or from Teams</strong>
</P>

<P align="justify">This parameter sets which is the classification
	used to calculate the final total score of the students.</P>
<P align="justify">There are two possibilities:</P>
<div align="justify">
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Students</strong>: the score of each student is taken
			from the individual ranking. However, if the option to work in teams
			is selected, the score of the team to which the student belongs will
			contribute to his individual score.</li>
		<li><strong>Teams</strong>: to calculate the scores of each
			student it is only used the teams' scores. This way, the students
			that belongs to the same team will be rewareded with the same score.
			For this possibility to make sense, the option <a
			href="help.php?module=quest&file=allowteams.html">Allow Teams</a>
			must be selected.</li>
	</ul>
