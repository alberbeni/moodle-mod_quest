<P ALIGN=CENTER><strong>Group Mode</strong></P>

<P align="justify">The group mode can be one of three levels:</P>
<div align="justify">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No groups</strong>: There are no sub groups, everyone is part of one big community.</li>
      <li><strong>Separate Groups</strong>: Each group can only see their own group, others are invisible. </li>
      <li><strong>Visible Groups</strong>: Each group works in their own group, but can also see other groups.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<P align="justify">The group mode can be defined at two levels:</P>

<div align="justify">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Course Level</strong>: The group mode defined at the course level is the default mode for all activities defined within that course.</li>
      <li><strong>Activity Level</strong>: Each activity that supports groups can also define its own grouping mode. If the course is set to "<a href="help.php?module=moodle&amp;file=groupmodeforce.html">force group mode</a>" then the setting for each activity is ignored.</li>
  </ul>
