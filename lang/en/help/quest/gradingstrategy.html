<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Scoring Strategy</B></P>

<P align="justify">The scoring strategy used to assess the answers submitted to the challenges proposed in a QUESTOURnament is acumulative.

<P align="justify">This means that in the scoring of each assessment a number of elements are used, and each one must cover a specific aspect of the task to be assessed. The number of assessment elements will depend of the size and complexity of the task. The assessment elements have the following characteristics:

<div align="justify">
  <OL>
      <li>DESCRIPTION of the assessment element. It should clearly determine which aspect of the task is being assessed. In the case of a qualitative assessment, it will be useful to provide details of what is considered excellent, average, etc.</li>
      <li>SCALE of the assessment element. There are several predetermined scales, from the simple YES/NO scale, to a scale of total percentage. Each assessment element will use its own scale, which must be choosen so that it can adjust to each possible variation of the element. However, it must be taken into account that the scale does not determine how important an assessment element is when the final score is calculated: for example, an element with a 2-point scale will have the same &quot;influence&quot; in the final score than another element that uses a 100-point scale, whenever the respective elements has the same <i>weight</i> or ponderation factor.</li>
      <li>WEIGHT of the assessment element. By default, each element has the same importance when the final score of the task is calculated. However, this fact can be changed by giving the more important elements a weight higher than one, and to the less important elements a weight lower than one. It must be also taken into account that to modify the weight does NOT affect the possible maximum score of a submitted answer, because this value is determined by the <a href="help.php?module=quest&file=maxcalification.html">Highest Score</a> parameter set for the challenge to which the answer is being submitted and the time when it was submitted.
      </li>
