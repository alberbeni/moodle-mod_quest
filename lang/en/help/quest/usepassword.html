<p align="center"><b>Use password</b></p>

<p align="justify">This option allows to set an access password to this QUESTOURnament. To protect a QUESTOURnament with a password can be necessary, for example, when that QUESTOURnament is used by several groups of students in a course, and must be opened to each group in a different time slot, in which case, the access password will not allow that a group of students can access the QUESTOURnament once it is opened to another different group of students but not for them yet.</p>
