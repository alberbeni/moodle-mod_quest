<p align="justify">QUESTOURnament promotes student's work, both individual and in teams.</p>
<p align="justify">QUESTOURnament offers the possibility of answering challenges or questions proposed by teachers or students during a period of time defined as the lifetime of a contest. Both the answers and the challenges submitted by students are assessed. These assessments are made by the teachers and by the students that have proposed challenges. The individual final score of each student will depend on these assessments. These individual scores and its evolution during the duration of the contest will be accessible at any time to the students through the contest ranking.</p>
<p align="justify">Assessment forms are defined both for the assessment of the challenges proposed, and of the answers submitted. These assessment forms include a set of assessment elements, with their corresponding weights, that allow to determine the score obtained.</p>
