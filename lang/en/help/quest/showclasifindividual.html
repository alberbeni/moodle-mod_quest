<P align="justify">
	This option is selected by default and allows that both the individual
	ranking and the team raking are shown, the latter one only in case that
	the option <a href="help.php?module=quest&file=allowteams.html">Allow
		Teams</a> is selected.

<P align="justify">If the option Allow Teams is not selected, it
	will only make sense to choose the default value of this option that
	shows the individual ranking.</P>
