<p align="center">
	<b>Number of Attachments expected on Submissions</b>
</p>

<p align="justify">This parameter sets how many text fields will be
	presented to allow the submission of files when a student or a teacher
	makes a submission. The value of this parameter must be between 0 and
	5. It will usually be 0 or 1, but in certain cases it can be necessary
	to allow the submission of more than one attachment. If the value
	specified is 0, that is also the default value for this parameter, this
	means that it will not be allowed to send any attachment with a
	submission.</p>
<p align="justify">If, for example, the number specified is 3, and
	only 2 files are attached to the submission, that submission is made
	without showing any warning message. This means that, when a submission
	is made, it is allowed to attach any number of files up to the maximum
	specified by this parameter.</p>
